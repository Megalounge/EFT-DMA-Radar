## Disclaimer ⚠️  
This app has been tested on 🪟 Windows 11 25H2 (Game) and 🪟 Windows 11 23H2 (Radar).  
⚠️ Older versions of Windows (e.g., Windows 10) may not work properly and are not officially supported.

**Note:** All current testing is done with both the radar and game running at **1920x1080** resolution.  

## Things I won't touch unless Mambo/x0m made it open source
- writing

- Quest tracker including zones, req. Keys and Items and only Q_items of active quests on radar/ESP/Aimview
- ...?

## Known Issues 🚨

- ESP and Aimview Head Circles are not handled (and are not code-wise) part of the skeleton and don't scale like you'd expect them to.

## Features ✨

- Configurable Aimview widget
- Loot Info widget
- 🛰️ ESP Fuser DX9 overlay
   - ESP has issues, especially when ADS and using optics. Work in progress 🛠

## Config File 📄

This Chair creates it's own Config folder to be distinguishable from other config folders.
- File location: C:\User\AppData\Roaming\Lum0s-EFT-DMA
- File name: Config-EFT.json
- Don't have a file with pre set Lootfilters and Watchlist? There's one in Master

##  Common Issues ⚠️

### DX Overlay/D3DX Errors ("DX overlay init failed", "ESP DX init failed: System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load DLL 'd3dx943.dll'...")

If you see an error like:

```
DX overlay init failed

ESP DX init failed: System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load DLL 'd3dx943.dll' or one of its dependencies: The specified module could not be found
```

This means your PC does **not** have the required legacy DirectX 9 *D3DX* runtime (specifically `d3dx9_43.dll`). Modern Windows installs (Windows 10/11) **do not include** this file by default.

**How to fix:**

1. **On your Radar PC**, download and run Microsoft’s official installer:

   👉 [DirectX End-User Runtime (June 2010)
   > Installing either of these will add the required DirectX 9 component (`d3dx9_43.dll`) and several others needed by the overlay.

2. **Follow the install prompts** to complete setup.

3. **Restart the radar app.** A full PC reboot may help but is usually not required.

**Do NOT** attempt to download `d3dx9_43.dll` from random third-party DLL sites. Use only Microsoft’s official installer.
